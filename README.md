# My Polybar configs

[polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar)



## Modules:
it has the following modules enabled and configured
```
modules-right = battery pulseaudio tray
modules-center = date
modules-left = i3
```
----------

## Note:
If you're on something like debian stable or oldstable, make sure you have polybar version >= 3.7.0 .
I've had to build a newer version on bookworm, your mileage may vary.
